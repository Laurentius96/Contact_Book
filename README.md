## 🔍 Overview

This project implements a complete digital contact book using Python. The application allows users to manage personal contacts through an interactive command-line interface, with features to add, view, edit, and remove contacts, as well as persist data in JSON format.

The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as:
- Data collection and manipulation
- Data structures (lists and dictionaries)
- Functions and code modularization
- Data persistence with JSON
- Command-line user interface

## 🛠️ Features

- **Add contacts**: Register new contacts with name, phone, and email
- **List contacts**: View all stored contacts
- **Search contacts**: Find contacts by name or partial name
- **Edit contacts**: Update information for existing contacts
- **Remove contacts**: Delete contacts from the address book
- **Data persistence**: Save and load contacts in JSON file

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **JSON**: Format for persistent data storage
- **Libraries**:
  - `json`: For JSON file manipulation
  - `os`: For operating system operations
  - `time`: For visual effects in the interface

## 📋 Project Structure

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Laurentius96/Contact_Book.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Contact_Book
   ```

3. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment:
   ```
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

4. Alternatively, run the script directly:
   ```
   python -m main.py
   ```

## 📊 Implementation Details

### User Interface
The application uses a command-line interface with visual elements to improve the user experience:
- Formatted headers
- Success, error, and information messages
- Stylized contact display
- Interactive menu

### Data Management
Contacts are stored as Python dictionaries within a list, with the following structure:
```python
{
  "name": "Contact Name",
  "phone": "Contact Phone",
  "email": "Contact Email"
}
```

### Persistence
The application automatically saves contacts to a JSON file (`book.json`), allowing data to be maintained between executions.

## 🎓 Learnings

This project demonstrates the practical application of various fundamental programming concepts:
- Data structure manipulation
- Functions and code modularization
- Exception handling
- Data persistence
- Command-line user interface
- User input validation
